# Report Card Data Structure

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-01

> **⚠️ PRIVACY NOTE:** This documentation must NOT contain real staff names. All staff names should be anonymized or shown as placeholders like `[Staff Name]`. Real names are stored in `staff.private.json` (gitignored) and processed via `processStaffNames()` utility.

## Navigation Flow

1. Login to `https://www.wellnessliving.com/rs/profile.html`
2. Click on "Forms" tab (`a:has-text("Forms")`)
3. View report list in table
4. Click on "Dayschool Report Card" link to open modal (`a:has-text("Dayschool Report Card")`)

| Amended By | Staff member who amended (if any) | "[Staff Name]" or empty |
| IP Address | IP address of submission | "70.77.40.201" |
| Action | View button (eye icon) | Clickable icon |

## Data Extraction Strategy

### From Report List Table
Extract these fields for each report:
- **date:** From "Completed On" column (parse "Oct 31, 2025, 2:11pm" → "2025-10-31")
- **completedDateTime:** Full timestamp
- **completedBy:** Staff name from "Completed By" column (**anonymize**)
- **amendedBy:** Staff name from "Amended By" column (**anonymize**)
- **addedBy:** Staff name from "Source" column (**anonymize**)

### From Report Card Modal
Extract these fields:
- **dogName:** From "My name" field (should always be "Pepper")
- **staffNames:** Array from "My Dayschool Trainer(s)" multi-select (**anonymize**)
- **grade:** From behavior radio buttons (A/B/C/D)
- **gradeDescription:** Full text of selected radio option
- **bestPartOfDay:** Selected option from dropdown
- **whatIDidToday:** Text from textarea
- **photos:** Array of photo URLs/references (if present)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Selectors for Scraping

**Modal Container:**
```typescript
const modal = page.locator('.css-popup-form-wrapper .css-wl-quiz-process-wrap').first();
```

**Modal Title (contains dog name):**
```typescript
const title = modal.locator('.js-wl-quiz-process-header');
// Example: "Dayschool Report Card for Pepper (John & Nadine)"
```

**Field Extraction Pattern:**
Each field is wrapped in a `.css-core-quiz-element-wrap` div with:
- Question: `.css-quiz-question`
- Answer: `.css-quiz-answer` (for read-only)
- or: `.js-core-quiz-response-component` (for form fields)

**Specific Field Selectors:**
```typescript
// Field 1: My name (read-only)
const myName = modal.locator('.css-quiz-question:has-text("My name")').locator('+ .css-col-100 .css-quiz-answer');

// Field 2: Trainers (multi-select)
const trainers = modal.locator('.css-quiz-question:has-text("Trainer")').locator('+ .css-col-100 select option[selected]');

// Field 3: Behavior grade (radio)
const grade = modal.locator('input[name="a_radio"]:checked');

// Field 4: Best part (dropdown)
const bestPart = modal.locator('.css-quiz-question:has-text("best part")').locator('+ .css-col-100 select option[selected]');

// Field 5: What I did today (textarea - need to verify selector)
const whatIDid = modal.locator('.css-quiz-question:has-text("What I did")').locator('+ .css-col-100 textarea');
```

### Modal State
The modal appears to load instantly with data already populated (disabled form fields showing completed report).
- All fields are `disabled` since this is a view-only mode
- Need to extract values from `selected` options and `checked` radio buttons
- Wait strategy: Look for modal title containing "Dayschool Report Card for"

### Photos
**Status:** Not yet discovered in exploration
**TODO:** Check for:
- Photo gallery or attachment section
- Image elements within modal
- Links to photo URLs
- May be in a separate tab or section of the modal

## Data Schema (Proposed)

```typescript
interface ReportCard {
  date: string;                    // "2025-10-31"
  completedDateTime: string;       // "2025-10-31T14:11:43"
  dog: {
    name: string;                  // "Pepper"
    owners: string;                // "John & Nadine"
  };
  staffNames: string[];            // ["River Oak"] (anonymized)
  grade: "A" | "B" | "C" | "D";
  gradeDescription: string;        // Full text
  bestPartOfDay: string;
  notes: string;                   // whatIDidToday field
  photos: string[];                // URLs or R2 references
  metadata: {
    addedBy: string;               // Anonymized
    completedBy: string;           // Anonymized
    amendedBy?: string;            // Anonymized
    ipAddress: string;
  };
}
```

## Privacy & Anonymization

**Must anonymize:**
- All staff names (from trainers list, completed by, added by, amended by)
- Process using `processStaffNames()` utility

**Do NOT anonymize:**
- Dog name ("Pepper")
- Owner names ("John & Nadine") - these are us!
- Activity descriptions
- Notes/comments

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Document complete data structure
2. 🔄 Verify photo extraction (not seen yet in modal)
3. ⏭️ Build TypeScript types for report data
4. ⏭️ Implement scraper that:
   - Navigates to Forms page
   - Iterates through all reports for a date/year
   - Opens each modal
   - Extracts all fields
   - Anonymizes staff names
   - Saves to JSON
