## Notes

- **Privacy:** Always anonymize staff names using `processStaffNames()` utility
- **Rate Limiting:** Use 3-5 second delays between scraper requests
- **Stock Photos:** Automatically filtered during extraction (SHA256 hash detection)
- **Backfill:** Run locally first time to monitor progress, then automation takes over
- **Testing:** Always test on single dates before batch operations
- **Notifications:** Skip for backfilled historical data (only for new daily reports)

## Production Site Status

**Live URL:** https://dogfamchat.github.io/pepper-report

**Working Features:**
- Homepage with latest report card and statistics
- Trends page with interactive Chart.js visualizations (grade timeline, distribution)
- Timeline page with all 31 report cards (expandable cards)
- Automated daily scraping and analysis via GitHub Actions
- Automated deployment on every push to main

**Missing Features:**
- Friend analysis and visualization (no AI extraction yet)
- Activity categorization and charts
- Photo display on website (photos exist in R2 but not shown)
- Friends page
- Photo gallery page
- Individual report card pages

## Key Technical Decisions

### Week Calculation
Using **ISO 8601 week numbers** for consistency:
- Week starts Monday, ends Sunday
- Week containing January 4th is week 1
- Implemented in `scripts/analysis/report-reader.ts:getWeekNumber()`

### Grade Storage Format
Storing both letter and numeric values:
```json
{
  "date": "2025-11-07",
  "grade": "A",
  "gradeValue": 4.0
}
```

### Data Organization
Separate directories for different purposes:
- `data/analysis/daily/` - Per-report analysis (cached AI extractions)
- `data/analysis/aggregates/` - Aggregated trends and statistics
- `data/viz/` - Chart.js-optimized data
- `data/reports/2025/` - Raw report card JSONs
- `data/schedule/` - Schedule data

**Incremental Architecture (Nov 9):**
- Daily analysis files stored once, never recalculated
- Aggregation reads daily files (no API calls)
- New reports only trigger extraction for that specific date
- Scales efficiently as dataset grows

### Chart.js Integration
- Self-contained `GradeCharts.astro` component
- Pass data via `data-*` attributes on canvas elements
- Use module script that imports Chart.js directly from npm
- Read data from DOM using dataset API

### Claude API Structured Outputs (Friend Analysis)
Using **tool_choice** for guaranteed JSON schema compliance:
- Model: `claude-haiku-4-5` (alias for latest Haiku)
- Define a `record_friends` tool with strict JSON schema
- Use `tool_choice: { type: 'tool', name: 'record_friends' }` to force structured output
- No markdown parsing needed - response guarantees valid JSON
- Cost: ~$0.0012 per full analysis run (31 reports × ~150 tokens)
- Filters: Exclude "Pepper" (can't be friends with herself)
- Sorting: By mention count (desc), then by most recent date (desc)
