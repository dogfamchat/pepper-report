# TODO - Pepper Report Project

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-15
**Current Phase:** Analysis & Visualization (Phase 3 - Complete)
**Current Branch:** behaviour-tracking (ready for PR)

## Overview

This tracks remaining work to complete the Pepper Report project. See [docs/design-proposal.md](docs/design-proposal.md) for full architecture and [docs/report-card-data-structure.md](docs/report-card-data-structure.md) for data schema details.

## Recent Progress

### Nov 16, 2025 - Code Cleanup & Label Formatting Consistency ✅ COMPLETE

**Branch:** `fix-activities-and-training` (ready for PR - pending GitHub Actions update)

**Completed:**
- ✅ **Additional Code Cleanup** (`scripts/analysis/`)
  - Deleted `activity-categories.ts` entirely (184 lines removed)
  - Removed unused functions from `activity-categorizer.ts` (~160 lines removed)
  - Removed unused interfaces and imports from `extract-daily.ts`
  - Removed categoryCounts/categoryPercentages from `activity-breakdown.json`
  - Total cleanup: 5 files, 76 insertions, 602 deletions
  - Commit: e2a7156

- ✅ **Category Label Formatting Fix**
  - Renamed category keys in learned mappings to include "and":
    - `impulse_control_focus` → `impulse_control_and_focus`
    - `handling_manners` → `handling_and_manners`
  - Updated all 34 daily analysis files with new category names
  - Regenerated visualization JSON files
  - Simple snake_case to Title Case conversion (keeps "and" lowercase)
  - No brittle special case handling needed
  - Total changes: 37 files, 157 insertions, 152 deletions
  - Commit: 6c51e1f

**Key Technical Decision:**
Rather than maintaining special case dictionaries for label formatting, we renamed the category keys themselves at the source (learned mappings) to include "and". This allows a simple converter to handle everything automatically without special cases:
```typescript
// Convert snake_case to Title Case (keep 'and' lowercase)
category.split('_')
  .map(word => word === 'and' ? 'and' : word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
  .join(' ')
```

### Nov 15, 2025 - AI-Powered Activity Categorization with Learned Mappings ✅ COMPLETE

**Branch:** `fix-activities-and-training` (ready for PR - pending GitHub Actions update)

**Context:**
After merging PR #10 (activity-categorization), we discovered that activities and training skills are NOT static - new ones are being added frequently. Two new items appeared that weren't in our manual mappings:
- "confidence building" (appeared in 9 reports starting Aug 8, 2025)
- "nose targeting" (appeared in 1 report on Nov 14, 2025)

**Problem:** Manual mapping maintenance would be ongoing burden as daycare adds new activities/skills.

**Solution:** Hybrid approach with AI categorization + learned mappings
1. Keep raw data frequency charts (never break)
2. Add AI-powered category suggestions using Claude Haiku 4.5
3. Use learned mappings to lock categories after first AI categorization (prevents drift)
4. Only new items trigger AI calls (cost-efficient)

**Completed So Far:**
- ✅ **AI Categorization Integration** (`scripts/analysis/extract-daily.ts`)
  - Added `categorizeWithAI()` function using Claude Haiku 4.5 API
  - Structured outputs with tool_choice for guaranteed JSON schema
  - Extended `DailyAnalysis` interface with `aiActivityCategories` and `aiTrainingCategories`
  - Cost: ~$0.00004 per report when AI is needed, $0 when using learned mappings

- ✅ **Learned Mappings System** (`scripts/analysis/extract-daily.ts`)
  - Checks learned mappings first before calling AI
  - Only unmapped items trigger AI categorization
  - Merges learned mappings with AI results
  - Returns early if all items found in cache (no AI call)
  - Verbose logging shows when AI is needed vs cached

- ✅ **Learned Mapping Files Created**
  - `scripts/analysis/learned-activity-mappings.json` (14 activities from manual approach)
  - `scripts/analysis/learned-training-mappings.json` (22 training skills including new ones)
  - Multi-category support preserved for activities
  - "confidence building" categorized as "physical_skills" (semantic reasoning: obstacles, surfaces, heights)
  - "nose targeting" categorized as "fun_skills"

- ✅ **AI Category Aggregation** (`scripts/analysis/activity-categorizer.ts`)
  - Created `aggregateAICategoryCounts()` function
  - Counts activity and training instances across all reports
  - Tracks total instances for percentage calculations

- ✅ **AI Category Visualization** (`scripts/analysis/aggregate.ts`)
  - Added `generateAIActivityCategoryViz()` and `generateAITrainingCategoryViz()`
  - Creates Chart.js configuration for horizontal bar charts
  - Outputs to `data/viz/ai-activity-categories.json` and `data/viz/ai-training-categories.json`

- ✅ **Interactive Charts on Trends Page** (`src/pages/trends.astro`)
  - Added "🤖 AI-Suggested Categories" section with 2 charts
  - Built category mappings from AI data (8 activity categories, 6 training categories)
  - Hover tooltips showing all items in each category (afterLabel callbacks)
  - Info icons (ℹ️) opening modals with complete category breakdowns
  - Modals list all items under each category with emoji headers
  - Same UX as manual charts

- ✅ **Testing** (Nov 14 report)
  - Verified learned mappings load correctly
  - Confirmed all known items found in cache (no AI call)
  - Processing time: 1.4s (vs ~2.8s with AI calls)
  - Output: "✅ All items found in learned mappings (no AI call needed)"

- ✅ **Initial AI Categorization** (one-time, Nov 15)
  - Regenerated all 34 daily analysis files with AI categories
  - 304 activity instances categorized across 34 reports
  - 118 training instances categorized across 34 reports
  - Total AI cost: ~$0.0014-0.0027 (one-time expense)

**Pending Tasks:**
- [x] **Regenerate All Daily Files with Learned Mappings** ✅ COMPLETED Nov 15
  - Ran extract-daily.ts for all 34 dates with learned mappings
  - Verified all items found in cache (no AI calls needed)
  - Confirmed data consistency across all files

- [x] **Regenerate Aggregate Data** ✅ COMPLETED Nov 15
  - Ran aggregation to update viz files
  - AI category charts use latest data
  - Chart.js configurations verified

- [x] **Code Cleanup - Remove Rules-Based Categorization** ✅ COMPLETED Nov 15
  - Removed old rules-based category visualization functions (~158 lines)
  - Deleted `data/viz/activity-categories.json` and `data/viz/training-categories.json`
  - Removed unused category map and color constants
  - Cleaned up analyze-all.ts to not generate old viz files
  - Made system fully dynamic from learned mappings

- [x] **Update UI Text** ✅ COMPLETED Nov 15
  - Changed "AI-Suggested Categories" to "Categories"
  - Changed chart titles from "AI Activity/Training Categories" to "Activity/Training Categories"
  - Updated subtitle to show counts: "14 activities • 22 training skills"
  - Removed explanatory subtitles from modals for cleaner UI

- [ ] **Update GitHub Actions Workflow**
  - Ensure learned mapping files are committed to Git
  - Verify extract-daily.ts runs with learned mappings in CI
  - Test that new activities trigger AI categorization and get saved to mappings
  - Add step to commit updated learned mappings if new items found

- [x] **Create Commit** ✅ COMPLETED Nov 15
  - Committed learned mappings implementation (commit: 0d912dc)
  - Included learned mapping JSON files
  - Included extract-daily.ts changes (cross-platform fix)
  - Included trends page updates (dynamic modals and tooltips)
  - Included aggregate.ts changes (removed old code)
  - 44 files changed, 440 insertions(+), 1046 deletions (net -606 lines)

**Key Technical Details for Future Claude Sessions:**

**File: `scripts/analysis/extract-daily.ts`**
- Location of learned mapping imports: Lines ~9-16 (after existing imports)
- Modified function: `categorizeWithAI()` (around line 150-250)
- Logic flow:
  1. Load `LEARNED_ACTIVITY_MAPPINGS` and `LEARNED_TRAINING_MAPPINGS` from JSON files
  2. Check all activities/training against learned mappings first
  3. Separate into `unmappedActivities` and `unmappedTraining` arrays
  4. Return early if all found in cache (no AI call)
  5. Only call AI for unmapped items
  6. Merge learned mappings with AI results
  7. Return combined categorizations

**Files: `scripts/analysis/learned-*-mappings.json`**
- `learned-activity-mappings.json`: 14 activities, multi-category support (array values)
- `learned-training-mappings.json`: 22 training skills, single category (string values)
- These are the "source of truth" for categories - edit these to change categorizations
- New items will be added here when AI categorizes them (future enhancement)

**File: `src/pages/trends.astro`**
- AI category section starts around line ~400 (after activity categorization section)
- Two category mappings built from AI data: `aiActivityCategoryItems` and `aiTrainingCategoryItems`
- Used for hover tooltips (afterLabel callbacks) and info modals
- Chart initialization uses these mappings to show items in each category

**Data Flow:**
1. Report scraped → stored in `data/reports/2025/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
2. `extract-daily.ts` reads report, checks learned mappings, calls AI if needed
3. Results saved to `data/analysis/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.json` with `aiActivityCategories` and `aiTrainingCategories`
4. `aggregate.ts` reads all daily files, aggregates AI categories, generates viz JSON
5. Trends page loads viz JSON and renders charts with interactive features

**Cost Analysis:**
- Initial categorization (34 reports): ~$0.0014-0.0027 one-time
- Future reports with learned mappings: $0 (no AI call if all items known)
- Future reports with NEW items: ~$0.00004 per report (only new items categorized)

**Why "confidence building" is physical_skills:**
- Not found in original manual mappings (bug in PR #10 - modal showed it but code didn't include it)
- Appeared in 9 reports starting Aug 8, 2025
- AI suggested "physical_skills" based on semantic reasoning
- User approved: obstacles, surfaces, heights, balance challenges = physical development

- **Privacy:** Always anonymize staff names using `processStaffNames()` utility
- **Rate Limiting:** Use 3-5 second delays between scraper requests
- **Stock Photos:** Automatically filtered during extraction (SHA256 hash detection)
- **Backfill:** Run locally first time to monitor progress, then automation takes over
- **Testing:** Always test on single dates before batch operations
- **Notifications:** Skip for backfilled historical data (only for new daily reports)

## Key Technical Decisions

### Week Calculation
Using **ISO 8601 week numbers** for consistency:
- Week starts Monday, ends Sunday
- Week containing January 4th is week 1
- Implemented in `scripts/analysis/report-reader.ts:getWeekNumber()`

### Grade Storage Format
Storing both letter and numeric values:
```json
{
  "date": "2025-11-07",
  "grade": "A",
  "gradeValue": 4.0
}
```

### Data Organization
Separate directories for different purposes:
- `data/analysis/daily/` - Per-report analysis (cached AI extractions)
- `data/analysis/aggregates/` - Aggregated trends and statistics
- `data/viz/` - Chart.js-optimized data
- `data/reports/2025/` - Raw report card JSONs
- `data/schedule/` - Schedule data

**Incremental Architecture (Nov 9):**
- Daily analysis files stored once, never recalculated
- Aggregation reads daily files (no API calls)
- New reports only trigger extraction for that specific date
- Scales efficiently as dataset grows

### Chart.js Integration
- Self-contained `GradeCharts.astro` component
- Pass data via `data-*` attributes on canvas elements
- Use module script that imports Chart.js directly from npm
- Read data from DOM using dataset API

### Claude API Structured Outputs (Friend Analysis)
Using **tool_choice** for guaranteed JSON schema compliance:
- Model: `claude-haiku-4-5` (alias for latest Haiku)
- Define a `record_friends` tool with strict JSON schema
- Use `tool_choice: { type: 'tool', name: 'record_friends' }` to force structured output
- No markdown parsing needed - response guarantees valid JSON
- Cost: ~$0.0012 per full analysis run (31 reports × ~150 tokens)
- Filters: Exclude "Pepper" (can't be friends with herself)
- Sorting: By mention count (desc), then by most recent date (desc)
