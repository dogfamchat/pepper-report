  "noteworthyComments": "I had a pawsome day in school 🐾. I worked really hard on my cues, especially listening to my name and ‘sit’. I even stayed focused when there were fun smells and other dogs around! After training, I got to PLAY, and it was the best part. I ran, zoomed, and made some new friends. I can’t wait to practice more and get even better💙",
