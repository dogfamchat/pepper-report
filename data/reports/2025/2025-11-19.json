  "noteworthyComments": "Today I worked on building my confidence with heights! First, I tried out a tall slide. I took my time sniffing and checking it out, and then I got brave and gave it a go! After that, I walked across a bridge made out of chairs. It felt a little wobbly, but I did it and I got more confident each time. I’m pretty proud of myself! 🐾✨",
