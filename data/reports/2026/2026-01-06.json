We did a relay race and I was ready to zoom First, I jumped over an agility jump, then I showed off my best spin, sat like a very good dog, and finished strong with a speedy recall back to my trainer. I used my listening ears, kept my focus, and had a blast cheering on my friends. I deserve extra treats and a nap now! My bestie was Ginny today",
