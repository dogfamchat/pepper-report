The staff would walk me on their belt and I was good with the leash but generally returned to whichever dog I was playing with before after being released. \nI did pretty good with the focus exercise today; for today’s focus exercise we had a Winter Olympics and ran through a tunnel, I was hesitant about going through the tunnel and only took a few steps but I tried my best.",
